# Puzzle_Hackathon_ACM
This project is for the ACM 2026 hackathon with the theme of puzzles. 

Planet Hopper is a game made with the ideas to explore our universe. There are different options to the game with the adaptability to go solo or duo. Once in the game you will be confronted with multiple obstables and puzzles for you to complete and reach a higher level. 

Make sure you enjoy the functions and elements present in the game. Have Fun !
